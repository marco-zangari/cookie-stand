Cookie Stand Sales Projections Week 2 Project, Code Fellows 201,
As a developer, I want to work with object-oriented programming to build this site.

As a developer, I have made a constructor function, CookieStore, which renders the name of the cookie store, the maximum number of customers per hour in the shop during the hours of operation, the minimum number of customers during the hours of operation for the shop, the average amount of cookies sold per person, the simulated amount of cookies sold per person, per hour, in the shop, and the total amount of cookies sold at each shop.
